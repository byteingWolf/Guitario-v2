![](https://github.com/wolf4fun/Guitario-v2/blob/master/guiIcons/music.png =250x250)

Guitario is a simple guitar chords recognition.

* Project is based on AI recognition of chroma-based features

## Chords currently implemented

* a
* am
* bm
* c
* d
* dm
* e
* em
* f
* g

## Training database contain 2000 images created from 2000 recordings of 10 guitar chords

# Recording database

* For each chord, there are 200 wav files sampled at 44.100 Hz and quantized at 16 bits.

* 100 first chords are recorded in an anechoic chamber and the 100 last are recorded in a noisy room 

Four guitar were used, WAV file numbers 

* [1-25]   : Guitar 1

* [26-50]  : Guitar 2

* [51-75]  : Guitar 3

* [76-100] : Guitar 4

* Database was provided by INTELSIG Laboratory, University of Li√®ge, Departement EECS

# Model training method

For training purpose tensorflow 2.3.1 was used.
Model was trained by usising 256x256 pixels images of chroma fetures of each recorded chords
